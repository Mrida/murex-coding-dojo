* GOL is fun!!
* 5 min was convenient, not too boring
* good be cool to have an animation at the end -> needs preparation
* sometimes it can be cumbersome to write tests before the code when one have the full vision of what to do
* there is an assertArrayEquals
* intelliJ has a lot of cool shortcuts
* very good to have enough food, saved us time
* food + code = fun
