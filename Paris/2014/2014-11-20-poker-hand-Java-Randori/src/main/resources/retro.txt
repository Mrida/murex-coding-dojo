    - its big, large, and difficult to manage in two hours
    - long setup process if not prepared before hand
    - Interesting subject :)
    - We are interested in completing this kata next time
    - comparing lists, java cannot do it because ... interesting
    - register before noon in order not to starve

    - :( No Falafel today ... my love is gone away
    - 8 is the limit for a dojo
    - Should we start a second dojo room ?
    - Katas are manageable at more than 8
    - We could continue again !
    - It was nice to continue, and to have a start point
    - We had a great "Ah" refactoring moment
    - Junit comparable testing is unreadable
    - Maybe we should use fest asserts for this
    - We missed Hoang's poker vocabulary
    - Cross Floor dojos are great
    - Let's try Java 8 next time
