# Retrospective

* :( No Falafel today ... my love is gone away
* 8 is the limit for a dojo
* Should we start a second dojo room ?
* Katas are manageable at more than 8
* We could continue again !
* It was nice to continue, and to have a start point
* We had a great "Ah" refactoring moment
* Junit comparable testing is unreadable
* Maybe we should use fest asserts for this
* We missed Hoang's poker vocabulary
* Cross Floor dojos are great
* Let's try Java 8 next time
