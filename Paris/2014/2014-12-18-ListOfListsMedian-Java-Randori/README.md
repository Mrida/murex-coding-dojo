# Retrospective

* TDD at its limits.
* TDD driven by algorithm, you cannot drive blind unit tests.
* acceptance test is working while we know some obvious test cases won't work.
* we didn't have the kata to give inputs/outputs/real acceptance test.
* we found a really under performing solution.
* missing jdk8...but the map reduce emerged from the code.
* we didn't correctly re-generate the equals and hashcode after adding the parameter.
* no TDD on the 3rd parameter.
* we did some bottom up programming, sometimes we could have done top down programming.
* mean value is easy to compute but does not contain any value, while median value is harder to compute but contains more value.
* still no pac man!
* BLV : boycott beef.
* hot in this place!
