# Retrospective

* We should have a better look at rules before starting coding
* The fact of being 4 has enabled us to code more
* The problem was interesting and less trivial than it seems
* We had troubles to choose a modeling for the problem
* In the end, we should have been faster
* Choosing relevant tests was quite hard
