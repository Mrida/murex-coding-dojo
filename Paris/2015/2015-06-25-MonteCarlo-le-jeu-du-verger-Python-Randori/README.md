# Retrospective

* Scala wasn't a good idea, issues with CyberDojo
* Python is awesome!
* Acceptance test requires the whole code to be written
* A bit like financial pricer testing
* Very difficult to test
* Using a dsl (as IMDB does for SQL) to separate the business logic from the technical layer might be an idea
