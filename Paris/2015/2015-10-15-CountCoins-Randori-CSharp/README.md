## Problem
There are four types of common coins in US currency:  
  - dimes (10 cents)
  - quarters (25 cents)
  - nickels (5 cents)
  - pennies (1 cent)

There are 6 ways to make change for 15 cents:
  - A dime and a nickel;
  - A dime and 5 pennies;
  - 3 nickels;
  - 2 nickels and 5 pennies;
  - A nickel and 10 pennies;
  - 15 pennies.

How many ways are there to make change for a dollar
using these common coins? (1 dollar = 100 cents).
