We would like to use existing mars rover kata code to move the robot.
Eventually, we did 2 sub groups for both subjects

# Retrospective

* We had a lot of trouble configuring the LEGO
* We had a lot fo trouble going on the TicTacToe : 
  * ruby language issues
  * understanding the previous code
  * writing tests
* Next time, we need to setup the LEGO bricks beforehand
* We had problems connecting a home device to MX_MOBILE
* ruby 'unless' rocks
* It allowed us to practice Ruby
