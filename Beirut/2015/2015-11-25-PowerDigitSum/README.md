###Problem Description

####Power Digit Sum
215 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.
What is the sum of the digits of the number 21000?

####Lexicographic Permutations
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
012   021   102   120   201   210
What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

#Retrospective - First Session

2. Thanks Maher for attending on your vacation day 
3. It turned out intellij is also powerful for Ruby as well 
4. Not a very easy problems when using ruby for the first time
