###Problem Description
###Number of Participants: 8
The Game of Life (or simply Life) is not a game in the conventional sense. There are no players, and no winning or losing. Once the "pieces" are placed in the starting position, the rules determine everything that happens later. Nevertheless, Life is full of surprises! In most cases, it is impossible to look at a starting position (or pattern) and see what will happen in the future.
The only way to find out is to follow the rules of the game.
Rules:
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

###Retrospective
It was nice
More familiar with TDD than the last time, applying the concept rather than learning. Searching for bugs was easier with incremental code
Nice to have people attending again, problem was nice due to related rules
Same as above points, better than last session
Wasted time to write test case, we would have taken time to write more code. Sad couldn't finish it
