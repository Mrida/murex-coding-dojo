###Problem Description

Unfortunately the seller does not want just one customer to buy a lot of flowers, so he tries to change the price of flowers for customers who have already bought some flowers.

You and your  K -1   friends want to buy all  N    flowers in such a way that you spend the least amount of money. You can buy the flowers in any order.


#Retrospective
1. Easy problem. Maybe future problems can be more difficult
2. It was nice to use Java8 streams and lambdas
3. Discussing the algorithm at first helped to solve the problem quickly
