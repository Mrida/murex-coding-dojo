###Problem Description

####Counting Code Lines
 Create a utility that counts the number of lines of actual code in a Java source file. As comments are not considered part of the actual code, they should be skipped.
 A comment can be either one line comment starting with double slash (//) or a multi-line comment using backslash star (/* */).


#Retrospective
1. I thought the problem was easier but there were too many test cases we didn't think of. +1
2. It was a nice problem and we approached the solution.
3. I hope we will continue it next time to finish it and have more flexible code design.
4. We were away of algorithms and it was still challenging.
5. I wish it was more algorithm related.
