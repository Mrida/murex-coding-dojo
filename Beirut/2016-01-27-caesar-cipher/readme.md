###Problem Description

####Caesar Cipher
Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it in a cipher. Caesar's cipher rotated every letter in a string by a fixed number, K, making it unreadable by his enemies. Given a string, S, and a number, K, encrypt S and print the resulting string.

Note: The cipher only encrypts letters; symbols, such as -, remain unencrypted.

4. We finished pending refactorings
5. We solved a new problem in the pending time
