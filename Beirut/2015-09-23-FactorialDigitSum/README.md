###Problem Description
n! means n × (n ? 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!


#Retrospective - First Session 
1. We might have a problem where we can apply TDD 
2. TDD made us think of the design 
3. It is better to have complex problems 
4. Complex problems trigger discussion 
5. I felt hard to follow up 
6. Better than straight forward problems 
7. I like the discussion before writing the code 
8. I understood the problem because of the discussion 
9. Discussions gave us ore than one algorithms 
10. To be continued in a later session
