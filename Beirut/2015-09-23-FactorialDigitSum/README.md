###Problem Description
n! means n × (n ? 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!


#Retrospective - First Session 
1. Very nice, applied TDD to the max 
2. Simple problem allowed us to refactor the code to an optimal state and apply TDD 
3. TDD in action 
4. I like the concept of BigInteger
5. Thanks for the chocolate 
6. It was nice to try the parametrized tests
