###Problem Description
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?


#Retrospective - First Session 
1. Like the division of the functions 
2. Smaller team thus we were able to do more rotations  
3. We had 2 problems one was easier than the other 
4. Solved the problems the most efficient way
5. it was cool that we worked on 2  problems in one session
