###Problem Description
Coffee Machine 
This mini project is used to learn Test Driven Development.

Of course, in your career, you have implemented more complicated stuff than a simple coffee machine that takes orders.

But to make this mini project more interesting here are simple rules you must follow:

1. All production code is written to make a failing test pass
2. Do the simplest thing that could work for the current iteration

During this session we split into 2 teams of 4. By the end of the sessions we shared the development details followed by each team. 

###Retrospective
1. Like to work on 2 laptops, more involved. like usage of design patterns (good cake). 
2. Feel we are over doing it with TDD
3. Like comparison between the 2 groups 
4. getting familiar with concept 
5. We are writing the code without knowing 
6. The problem is nice because it is related to real life problems
